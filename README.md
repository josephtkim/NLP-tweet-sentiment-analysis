# NLP-tweet-sentiment-analysis
Transformer-based encoders to classify tweet sentiment.

This project utilizes the [Sentiment140 dataset](http://help.sentiment140.com/for-students) training.csv data. 

I use two types of models for this project:
- The first model is an encoder based on the Transformer Encoder architecture.
- The second model uses the BERT pre-trained model with fully connected linear layers.

For every run, the BERT-based model always performed better.
